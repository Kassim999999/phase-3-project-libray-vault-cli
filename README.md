# ðŸ“š Library Vault

## Description

The **Library Vault** is a command-line application built with Python and SQLAlchemy. It allows a library to manage books, members, and borrowing history in an organized way using object-oriented models and a relational database.

This project demonstrates model relationships, data seeding, and database interactions using an ORM rather than raw SQL.

---

## Features

- Add and manage books
- Register and manage members
- Record book borrowing and returns with date tracking
- View availability of books
- See borrowing history per member

---

## Data Model

- `Book`: Represents a book in the library  
- `Member`: A registered person who can borrow books  
- `BorrowRecord`: A join model linking Members and Books with additional data like borrow and return dates

**Relationships:**
- A book can be borrowed by many members 
- A member can borrow many books
- The many-to-many relationship is managed through `BorrowRecord`
